## Hi Recruiter!

Hope you are doing all well!

As a brief background, I am a 21-year-old who dropped out of the University of Toronto halfway. Being a self-starter, I always feel like I can learn a lot more outside of school, so I made the decision and won't regret it. Despite knowing it might be a challenging path, I took it anyway and will follow through.

Currently, I am employed as a research and business development professional at Multiplex Labs (https://multiplexlabs.xyz), where I specialize in validating and providing infrastructure for IBC networks with a particular focus on blockchain scalability and modularity by understanding how they actually work, what are the fundamentals and technology behind.

Working at Multiplex has been an enlightening experience. It has allowed me to engage with significant industry players such as dYdX, Delphi Labs, Zetachain, Cosmos, and various IBC blockchain foundations. Moreover, I have contributed to the growth of the organization's portfolio companies, including Galxe and Space.ID.

In addition to my research expertise, I have also gained valuable experience in growth strategies while serving at Clique (https://clique.social) as a Growth Associate. At Clique, I designed and executed user growth campaigns for notable clients, achieving impressive engagement on platforms like Twitter. Additionally, during my tenure as a Content Marketing Lead at Chainpeak (https://www.chainpeak.io), I successfully created educational content pieces, whitepapers, and press releases to effectively engage the community. These experiences have honed my sourcing and content creation skills, enabling me to make a lasting impact in various roles.

My resume is uploaded in this repository  . I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to your organization's growth and success. BTW I am fluent in both English and Mandarin, facilitating effective communication and collaboration with diverse teams.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eagerly looking forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to your mission. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number] to arrange an interview or request any additional information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
