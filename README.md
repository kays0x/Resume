## Hi Recruiter!

A brief introduction about myself: I was a 21-year-old student pursuing my degree at the University of Toronto. As a firm believer in the power of real-world experience, I had taken a calculated risk in 2021 to pause my studies and immerse myself in the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. This decision had allowed me to gain hands-on experience and invaluable insights that classroom learning alone couldn't provide. Having enriched my perspective and skill set, I had returned to campus last year to continue my formal education, now armed with a unique blend of academic knowledge and practical industry experience.

From my last job, I had been diving deep into the world of blockchain infrastructure. It had been an eye-opening experience. I had gained a comprehensive understanding of how blockchain worked, the scalability issues involved, and the modular architecture of blockchain systems, etc. Through research and analysis, I had gained valuable insights into designing and implementing top-notch infrastructure solutions for these networks.

What was amazing about working at Multiplex was that I had had the opportunity to collaborate with some big players in the industry, including dYdX, Delphi Labs, Zetachain, Cosmos, and various IBC blockchain foundations. It had been incredibly inspiring, and I had learned so much from these interactions.

Moreover, I had also had the chance to explore growth strategies as a Growth Associate at Clique. I had designed and executed user growth campaigns for some awesome clients and the user flow on the platform. We had seen some seriously impressive engagement on Twitter. And my time as a Content Marketing Lead at Chainpeak. I had gotten to create educational content pieces, whitepapers, and press releases that really connected with the community. These experiences had helped me develop a knack for sourcing knowledge, learning new stuff and creating engaging content.

I had uploaded my resume to this repository in case you wanted to take a look. I would have loved the opportunity to chat more about how my skills and experiences could contribute to your organization's growth and success. And just to let you know, I was fluent in both English and Mandarin, so communication wouldn't be an issue.

Thank you so much for considering my application. I genuinely looked forward to the possibility of joining your team and being part of your mission. Feel free to contact me via Telegram or email. I was there and excited to chat.
